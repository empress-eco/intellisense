## About The Project

Intellisense is a robust extension for Visual Studio Code (VSCode) that supercharges your Empress development projects with intelligent programming assistance. Designed with developers in mind, Intellisense offers features like autocompletion, translation string diagnostics, and method source navigation. These features aim to streamline your development workflow, boosting productivity and enhancing code quality.

### Key Features

- **Document Autocompletion**: Intuitively autocompletes fieldnames after typing 'self.' in DocType classes and for document objects created by 'get_doc'.
- **Translation String Diagnostics**: Highlights and reports incorrect usage of translation strings as an error.
- **Method Source Navigation**: Navigate directly to the patch source file by command clicking any patch method in 'patches.txt'.

### Built With

- [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
- [Python](https://www.python.org/)
